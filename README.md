<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Adam Robinson</h1>
<h3 align="center"> I've been running a personal training business for over six years, and when COVID hit, my business came to a halt for six months. I began to evaluate how I could become operational again, and I decided I was going to move my business to be fully operational out of my home. There was a lot of downtime and projects to complete to make my home suitable for clients. I am always looking for ways to self-improve, and during that downtime, I began to dive into software engineering. I wanted to be able to create my own website and applications for my business.
As a trainer, one of the most significant issues is getting clients to work on their nutrition. I handle their customized workouts and plans, but without the ability to professionally provide meal plans, there was a gap in success for my clients. I decided to make my own application for clients where they can log in, see healthy recipes added by other members of the community, can add, edit, and delete their recipes, and be able to favorite recipes for easy viewing later. In addition, they can add ingredients or individual items to a grocery list. This has helped my clients stay on a healthier track.
During this deep dive into software engineering, a light switch flipped in my mind. I enjoyed building applications and learning new things every day. It wasn’t long into my journey that I became enthralled with the ability to imagine, create, and solve real problems with code. I decided to make a pivot in my career, and I went all-in on software development.
When I am not coding, my wife and I explore as many national parks as we can! We have a lofty goal of making it to all of them, and we take our pups as often as possible!
