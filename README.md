<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Adam Robinson</h1>
<h3 align="center"> I've been running a personal training business for over six years, and when COVID hit, my business also took a hit. I relied on my engineering skillset to freelance while I worked on getting my business back on its feet. Once I was operational again, I didn't want to stop coding and learning. As a trainer, one of the biggest issues is getting clients to work on their nutrition. I handle their customized workouts and plans, but without the ability to professionally provide meal plans, there was a gap in success for my clients. I decided to make my own application for clients where they can log in, see healthy recipes added by other members of the community, can add, edit, and delete their recipes, and be able to favorite recipes for easy viewing later. In addition, they can add ingredients or individual items to a grocery list. This has helped my clients stay on a healthier track. Once I saw and experienced the ability to imagine, create, and solve real problems with code, I went all-in on software development.
